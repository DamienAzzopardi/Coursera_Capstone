    "**The Green Alternative** is a group of vegetarian restaurants, which started operating in Madrid, Spain, in 2010. We are currently running six different restaurants across different neighborhoods in Madrid, oriented towards locals. As our group is becoming successful in the spanish capital, this year, we would like to expand our operations and open a vegetarian restaurant in Barcelona.\n",

    "- Have a **park** or **garden** closeby, where our customers like to have lunch.\n",
